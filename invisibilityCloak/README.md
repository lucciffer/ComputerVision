Instructions to simulate the project of invisibility cloak:

1. Download all the files and install all the necessary libraries in order to run the file.
2. Run the file in your favourite/any IDE,
3. move out of the camera frame before the program starts running and a window for capturing live data from webcam appears.
4. stay out of the frame for about 3-5 seconds after the webcam windows pops up.
5. later, take a red colored towel/t-shirt/any red colored cloth, and hold it in front of the webcam, the area of the cloth appears to be invisible, i.e., the area will be filled with background and not the cloth itself
6. you can modify the program to work with cloak of any other color, to do that, all you need to change is the color values. 

This project is tested, and works absolutely fine.
